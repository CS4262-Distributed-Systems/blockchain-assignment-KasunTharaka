Distributed Ledger - The distributed ledger database is distributed among several peer-to-peer nodes, each of which duplicates and saves an identical copy of the ledger and updates itself independently. When an update occurs, each node creates a transaction and uses a consensus algorithm to select the correct copy. It is not possible to make modifications after an update has occurred.

Consensus protocol - A consensus protocol is an algorithm that establishes a set of rules that govern how nodes on a blockchain agree on which transaction is valid when several transactions are made by different nodes.
